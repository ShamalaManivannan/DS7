1st - Firstly to gather all the data and to upload/load into the program.
2nd - Data Preprocessing, You already prepare the data beforehand for future machine learning projects.
3rd - Data Analysis, You take importance and fully analyse the data so we know properly our input and output columns and delete/drop the rest as they arent needed.
4th - Define Input and Output, The input and output are each seperated into different dataframes.
5th - Perform the test-train split, Split up the data into a testing(75-70%) and training(25-30%) data.
6th - To perform the training of the model select the machine learning alogrithm.
7th - Perform predictions aswell as compare the predictions with the actual result to calculate accuracy.
